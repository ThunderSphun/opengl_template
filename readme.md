# OpenGL Template

This template is meant as a personal getting started 'hello world'
kind of program  
The template will be expanded when I see fit,
but will be kept bare bones.

## Libs used

- [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2)
for window creation and window events
- [Glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for OpenGL calls
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for OpenGL math in c++ code
- [Dear ImGui (Docking)](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/docking)
  for extra windows, and debug stat showing

_(*For now Dear ImGui is used for debug windows.
The idea is to make everything rendered through Dear ImGui)_  
_(*Glad will be build locally whenever the files do not exist yet ,
Glad itself does not have code when cloned)_
